Statically typed languages
They are called are compiled programmed language,because they are runned by COMPILERS.every single code written in static typed language are converted into machine code ie binary code 0 and 1 and it goes to another machine.for example a code has line of 50 after entering all 50 lines the code will be compiled once the code is fully typed it will be executed.the programmer should specify what type of each type of variable in the code.the checkings are done by the compiler and lot of error are checked in the early stages.
fox example- C,C++,Java.


Dynamically typed languages
These are called as the interpreted programming language.The code been runned line by line.progammer doesnt need to specify variables/fields/etc.This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time.these are also called as scripting languages.

Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang


Scripting languages
Scripting languages are programming languages that don't require an explicit compilation step.you have to compile a C program before you can run it. But in the normal case, you don't have to compile a JavaScript program before you run it. So JavaScript is sometimes called a "scripting" language.
examples Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang

Programming languages
programming languages are the languages which need the compilation step.statically typed languages are programming languages.
example-C,C++,D,Java (but note that Java is compiled to bytecode, which is then interpreted and/or recompiled at runtime),Pasc



Programming Paradigms
A programming paradigm is a style, or “way,” of programming.
Imperative: Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
Declarative: Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
Structured: Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.
Procedural: Imperative programming with procedure calls.
Functional (Applicative): Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
Function-Level (Combinator): Programming with no variables at all.
Object-Oriented: Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects have their own internal (encapsulated) state and public interfaces. Object orientation can be:
Class-based: Objects get state and behavior based on membership in a class.
Prototype-based: Objects get behavior from a prototype object.
Event-Driven: Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.
Flow-Driven: Programming processes communicating with each other over predefined channels.
Logic (Rule-based): Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions.
Constraint: Programming by specifying a set of constraints. An engine finds the values that meet the constraints.
Aspect-Oriented: Programming cross-cutting concerns applied transparently.
Reflective: Programming by manipulating the program elements themselves.
Array: Programming with powerful array operators that usually make loops unnecessary.
Paradigms are not meant to be mutually exclusive; a single program can feature multiple paradigms!
